Hiya! Welcome to Speakeasy's Github. This is where we are building the world's developer-first API platform. 

Our API platform automates the common operations associated with building and maintaining REST APIs. With just a few lines of code, developers who integrate the Speakeasy SDK will get access to auto-generated customer usage dashboards, schema validation, and a test suite generated from live API traffic. We also have plans to add support for rate limiting, key management and much more.

If you're interested, [we'd love for you join the waitlist](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/request-access) and we'll be sure to get you onto the platform as soon as possible!

## Why an API Platform?

APIs are really hard to build and maintain: there’s a long list of tasks that have to be addressed to offer robust, user-friendly APIs. Client experience (docs, SDKs) is one set of problems; testing, monitoring, infrastructure, and a myriad of other “behind-the-scenes” issues constitutes a huge range of other problems. The largest companies hire platform engineering teams in an attempt to address these, but most companies can’t fund or find such engineers. More automated, developer-friendly approaches don’t exist. 

## Why Speakeasy?

Speakeasy aims to change this. **We are the API Platform team for every company.** With just a few lines of code, developers get a dashboard that provides transparency into API changes, customer usage, generates tests from real traffic, and integrates into the rest of your API stack along with all the quality fittings needed to operationalize APIs in minutes. Our goal is to help companies launch and grow their business with easy-to-use API tooling that works at any scale.
