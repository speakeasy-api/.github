## Welcome to Speakeasy's Github! 
#### This is where we are building **world-class Developer Experience for your API**. 

Speakeasy's Client SDKs and Developer Experience POrtal help you acheve faster & easier integration for your API. Just add our SDK (3 lines of code) to your API handlers and get immediate access to a suite of DevEx that speed up customer integration and enable self-service support for your API. We're the API Platform team for every company!

* **Client SDKs** are publically [available via the Speakeasy CLI](https://docs.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/speakeasy-cli/getting-started). We support Typescript, Python, Go, Java, Php, C#, Ruby, Rust and Terraform ! 
* **Developer Experience Portals** are available to users who [join our beta program](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/request-access). Request access and we'll be sure to get you onto the platform as soon as possible!
